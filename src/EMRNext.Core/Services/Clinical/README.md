# Clinical Workflow Management

## Overview
The Clinical Workflow Management system provides a robust, flexible framework for managing complex clinical processes within the EMRNext healthcare platform.

## Key Features
- Dynamic Workflow Creation
- Granular Step Tracking
- Flexible Workflow Types
- Comprehensive Status Management
- Detailed Audit Capabilities

## Workflow Types
1. Medical Consultation
2. Diagnostic Procedure
3. Prescription Management

## Workflow Status
- Pending
- In Progress
- Completed
- Suspended
- Cancelled

## Workflow Priority Levels
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Urgent

## Usage Example
```csharp
// Create a new medical consultation workflow
var workflow = await _clinicalWorkflowService.CreateWorkflowAsync(
    patientId: "PATIENT_123", 
    workflowType: "MedicalConsultation",
    priority: WorkflowPriority.High
);

// Complete a workflow step
await _clinicalWorkflowService.CompleteWorkflowStepAsync(
    workflowId: workflow.Id,
    stepId: specificStepId,
    action: new WorkflowStepAction { ... }
);

// Update workflow status
await _clinicalWorkflowService.UpdateWorkflowStatusAsync(
    workflowId: workflow.Id,
    newStatus: WorkflowStatus.InProgress
);
```

## Performance Considerations
- Use async methods for non-blocking operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed workflows
- Monitor and optimize workflow creation and update processes

## Security Considerations
- Implement role-based access control
- Log all workflow modifications
- Validate user permissions for workflow actions

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning-powered workflow optimization
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Cross-system workflow synchronization
