# Predictive Analytics in EMRNext

## Overview
The Predictive Analytics module provides advanced machine learning capabilities to support clinical decision-making and patient care management.

## Key Features
- Disease Risk Prediction
- Treatment Adherence Forecasting
- Machine Learning Model Training
- Comprehensive Logging and Error Handling

## Supported Predictions
1. **Disease Risk Prediction**
   - Diabetes Risk
   - Heart Disease Risk
   - Hypertension Risk

2. **Treatment Adherence Prediction**
   - Probability of Patient Adherence
   - Confidence Metrics

## Usage Examples

### Predicting Disease Risk
```csharp
var diseaseRisk = await _predictiveAnalyticsService.PredictDiseaseRiskAsync(patientId);
Console.WriteLine($"Diabetes Risk: {diseaseRisk.DiabetesRisk}");
```

### Predicting Treatment Adherence
```csharp
var adherencePrediction = await _predictiveAnalyticsService.PredictTreatmentAdherenceAsync(patientId);
Console.WriteLine($"Adherence Probability: {adherencePrediction.AdherenceProbability}");
```

### Training Machine Learning Models
```csharp
var trainingResult = await _predictiveAnalyticsService.TrainDiseaseRiskModelAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Model trained with {trainingResult.NumberOfPatients} patients");
```

## Configuration
Add predictive analytics to your dependency injection in `Startup.cs`:
```csharp
services.AddPredictiveAnalytics();
```

## Performance Considerations
- Models are trained asynchronously
- Caching mechanisms reduce computational overhead
- Logging captures performance metrics

## Future Roadmap
- Expand prediction models
- Improve feature engineering
- Integrate with clinical decision support systems

## Dependencies
- Microsoft.ML
- Microsoft.ML.DataView
- Microsoft.ML.AutoML
